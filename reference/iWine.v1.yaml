  description: "iWine HTTP API. Get current wine volume (in litres), alcohol contents (% by volume), sugar (% by mass), temperature, wine type (as a JSON list of strings and certainty values: `{\"red\":90, \"white\":1,  \"rose\":9, \"orange\":0}`). Aerate contents or cool/warm to the desired temperature. Set callback URL to receive notifications to your device within LAN.\n\n## Security\n\nSince iWine must work on a LAN with no guarantee of access to the Internet and CA infrastructure, it relies on a custom variant of the HOBA security scheme for mutual authorization and authentication of controllers and iWine devices.\n\nTo authorize a controller with iWine device press **PAIR** button on iWine control panel, \"PAIRING MODE\" should appear on its LED display. When in pairing mode, iWine will accept valid authorization request from a controller and display its network name (if available) or IP address on the LED display with a scrolling message: \"LONG PRESS **PAIR** TO CONFIRM, SHORT PRESS TO CANCEL\". Users can confirm or cancel authorization accordingly.\n\nTo initiate a pairing request controller must generate a secp256k1 128-bit key pair and send a POST HTTP request to iWine `/pair` endpoint with its public key in its body. If this request was accepted by iWine and confirmed by its user in a timely manner, iWine will generate a keypair and return the public key in the POST response body with HTTP code 201. It will accept only the first valid pairing request and ignore all subsequent requests to the `/pair` endpoint until this pairing session ends and another one starts. If there were no valid pairing requests, the pairing mode would time out in 1 minute. Users can abort pairing mode sessions by short-pressing **PAIR** again at any time.\n\nThe proposed security scheme does not protect from MITM and replay attacks, as we consider their mitigation outside of the scope of this task.\n\n## Requesting iWine status information\n\nTo request iWine status information controller must send a GET request to the `/status` endpoint. To authenticate itself it passes its public key and its public key, signed by the controller's private key as `key` and `sig` strings, base64-encoded, as parameters of the GET request.\niWine will lookup the provided public key in its internal database of known controllers (that is stored in NVRAM) and, if found, checks the signature:\n\n```\nif (secp256k1.ecdsaVerify(signature: Uint8Array.from(sig), message: Uint8Array.from(key), publicKey: Uint8Array.from(key))) {\n  // OK\n  }\n  else {\n  // ERROR\n  }\n```\n  \nIf verification succeeds, iWine constructs a status response payload, a JSON object of the following format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"temp\": _contents_temperature_Celsius_,\n  \"alc\": _alcohol_contents_by_volume_cl_per_l_,\n  \"vol\": _volume_of_contents_l_,\n  \"type\": {\n    \"red\": _certainty_level_,\n    \"white\": _certainty_level_,\n    \"rose\":  _certainty_level_,\n    \"orange\":  _certainty_level_\n  }\n  \"operations\": {\n    \"aeration\": _aeration_status_,\n    \"settemp\": _settemp_status_\n    }\n}\n```\nwhere\n\n**_contents_temperature_Celsius_** _(integer number)_: the temperature of the wine in Celsius degrees, 0-100;\n**_alcohol_contents_by_volume_cl_per_l_** _(integer number)_: alcohol contents in centilitre per litre, 0-100;\n**_volume_of_contents_l_** _(float number)_: current volume of iWine contents 0-10;\n**_certainty_level_** _(integer number)_: a certainty level that the contents of iWine correspond to a given type of wine according to iWine machine-learning algorithm, 0-100;\n**_aeration_status_** _(integer number)_: reports the progress of aeration operation, 1 for an operation has just started, 100 for an operation that has completed, 0 for idle (an operation was not requested), -1 for a failed operation, -1-100;\n**_settemp_status_** _(array of 2 integer numbers)_: the first value of the array reports the progress of a cooling/warming operation, 1 for an operation that has just started, 100 for an operation that has just completed, 0 for idle (an operation was not requested), -1 for a failed operation; the second value designates the target temperature of the ongoing (or failed) operation (would be 0 for idle).\n\nThe 100% progress value of _settemp_status would time out after 1 minute and return to 0 (idle).\n\n#### Status Response Payload Example\n\n```\n{\n  \"temp\": 10,\n  \"alc\": 15,\n  \"vol\": 3.5,\n  \"type\": {\n    \"red\": 99,\n    \"white\": 0,\n    \"rose\":  1,\n    \"orange\":  0\n  }\n  \"operations\": {\n    \"aeration\": 50,\n    \"settemp\": [1,15]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis example payload means that the contents of iWine are most likely a red wine (but also could be rose, though highly unlikely) of 10 degrees Celsius with alcohol contents of 15% and volume of 3.5 liters. There are two ongoing operations: aeration is 50% complete while heating has just started with the target temperature of 15 degrees Celsius. \n\nIf verification failed, the `/status` endpoint would respond with `401 Unauthorized` error or `400 Bad Request` if the GET request was malformed.\n\n## Sending Commands to iWine\n\nTo aerate the contents of iWine device or cool/warm  the contents to a specified temperature, an authorized controller must send a POST request to `/command` endpoint. To authenticate the request, the requesting controller must include its public key as a base64-encoded string `key` and its public key signed with its private key as a base64-encoded string `sig` along with a _**command payload**_ in the body of the request.\n\nA _**command payload**_ is a JSON object consisting of one or both of the following items:\n`\"settemp\":\"_temperature_Celsius_\"`,\n`\"aerate\":\"on\"`\nand\n`\"callback\":\"_callback_URL_\"`\nto cool/warm and/or start aeration of the contents.\nThe cooling/warming process takes about 10 to 15 minutes and completes automatically.\nWhen each of the requested processes completes, iWine will make a POST HTTP request to _callback_URL_, if provided in the payload. The body of the callback POST request will then contain a _callback_payload_:\n`aerate: ok` or`aerate: failed`;\n`settemp: _temperature_Celsius_` or `settemp: -1`, depending on the success of the requested operations (-1 for a failed heating/cooling operation);\n\nTo maintain the security of communication, both _command_payload_ and _callback_payload_ must be encrypted with the private key of the request recipient.\n\nAll the parameters in a command payload are optional, but a valid command payload must have at least one of the two operation parameters: \"aerate\" or \"settemp\".\n\nThe order of parameters is irrelevant.\n\n#### _command_payload_ Example\n\n```\n{\n  \"settemp\":15,\n  \"aerate\":\"on\",\n  \"callback\":\"192.168.0.105/iwine\"\n}\n```\n\nThis payload will instruct iWine to cool or warm the contents to 15 degrees Celsius, aerate the wine and call the provided endpoint after the completion of each operation, providing the information about its success or failure.\n  "
